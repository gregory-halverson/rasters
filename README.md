The software addresses several challenges in the field. It makes swath remote sensing datasets more accessible and easier to work with. It also associates coordinate reference systems with vector geometries, simplifying transformations between projections.

The software improves upon existing packages such as rasterio, shapely, pyresample, and GDAL by encapsulating functionalities into objects and providing a more user-friendly interface. It is inspired by and aims to be a Python equivalent for the raster package in R and the Rasters.jl package in Julia.

Developed under a research grant by the NASA Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the software was designed for use by the Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission and the Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) mission. However, its utility extends to general remote sensing and GIS projects in Python.

The software has potential commercial applications in remote sensing data analysis and pipeline construction. It meets the SPD-41 open-science requirements of NASA-funded ROSES projects by being published as an open-source software package.

The advantage of this software package is that it brings together common geospatial operations in a single easy to use interface. It is useful for both remote sensing data analysis and building remote sensing data pipelines. It is anticipated to be of interest to those involved in remote sensing and GIS projects in Python.

### This software accomplishes the following:

This python package handles reading, writing, visualizing, and resampling of gridded and swath raster data.

### What are the unique features of the software?
- object oriented interface for ease of use
- rasters and raster geometries as objects

## Installation

The `rasters` package is available as a [pip package on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/rasters/):

```
pip install rasters
```

## Examples

Import the `Raster` class from the `rasters` package.

```python
from rasters import Raster
```

Supply the filename to the `open` class method of the `Raster` class. Placing the variable for the `Raster` object at the end of a Jupyter notebook cell displays a map of the image. The default `cmap` used in the map is `viridis`.

```python
raster = Raster.open("ECOv002_L2T_LSTE_33730_008_11SPS_20240617T205018_0712_01_LST.tif")
raster
```

## Usage

### Working with Raster Objects

The `Raster` class is the primary interface for working with raster data. It encapsulates both the data array and its georeferencing information.

#### Opening and Creating Rasters

```python
from rasters import Raster

# Open a raster from file
raster = Raster.open("path/to/file.tif")

# Create a raster from a numpy array and geometry
import numpy as np
from rasters import RasterGrid

data = np.random.rand(100, 100)
geometry = RasterGrid.from_bbox(
    xmin=-120, ymin=30, xmax=-110, ymax=40,
    cell_size=0.1
)
raster = Raster(data, geometry=geometry)
```

#### Raster Properties

```python
# Access the data array
array = raster.array

# Get dimensions
rows, cols = raster.shape
print(f"Raster size: {rows} rows x {cols} cols")

# Get coordinate reference system
crs = raster.crs

# Get bounding box
bbox = raster.bbox

# Get cell size
cell_size = raster.cell_size
```

#### Raster Operations

```python
# Arithmetic operations
raster_sum = raster1 + raster2
raster_diff = raster1 - raster2
raster_product = raster1 * raster2
raster_quotient = raster1 / raster2

# Comparison operations
mask = raster > 0.5

# Reproject to different coordinate system
reprojected = raster.reproject(crs="EPSG:4326", target_cell_size=0.01)

# Resample to a different geometry
resampled = raster.to_geometry(target_geometry, resampling="bilinear")

# Sample at a point
from rasters import Point
point = Point(-115, 35, crs="EPSG:4326")
value = raster.to_point(point)
```

#### Saving Rasters

```python
# Save as GeoTIFF
raster.to_geotiff("output.tif", compression="deflate")

# Save as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)
raster.to_COG("output_cog.tif")

# Save as GeoPackage
raster.to_geopackage("output.gpkg")
```

#### Visualization

```python
# Display in Jupyter notebook (automatic when last line in cell)
raster

# Create a matplotlib figure
fig = raster.imshow(
    title="My Raster",
    cmap="viridis",
    figsize=(10, 8)
)

# Save as image
image = raster.to_pillow(cmap="jet")
image.save("preview.png")
```

### Working with RasterGrid

The `RasterGrid` class represents gridded raster geometry with uniform cell spacing and north-oriented grids.

#### Creating RasterGrid Objects

```python
from rasters import RasterGrid

# From bounding box and cell size
grid = RasterGrid.from_bbox(
    xmin=-120, ymin=30, xmax=-110, ymax=40,
    cell_size=0.001,
    crs="EPSG:4326"
)

# From bounding box and shape
grid = RasterGrid.from_bbox(
    xmin=-120, ymin=30, xmax=-110, ymax=40,
    shape=(1000, 1000),
    crs="EPSG:4326"
)

# From affine transform
from affine import Affine
affine = Affine(0.001, 0, -120, 0, -0.001, 40)
grid = RasterGrid.from_affine(affine, rows=1000, cols=1000, crs="EPSG:4326")

# From coordinate vectors
x_vector = np.linspace(-120, -110, 1000)
y_vector = np.linspace(30, 40, 1000)
grid = RasterGrid.from_vectors(x_vector, y_vector, crs="EPSG:4326")

# From a raster file
grid = RasterGrid.open("path/to/file.tif")
```

#### RasterGrid Properties

```python
# Get grid dimensions
rows = grid.rows
cols = grid.cols

# Get cell size
cell_width = grid.cell_width
cell_height = grid.cell_height

# Get extent
xmin, ymin = grid.xmin, grid.ymin
xmax, ymax = grid.xmax, grid.ymax
width, height = grid.width, grid.height

# Get coordinate arrays
x = grid.x  # 2D array of x-coordinates
y = grid.y  # 2D array of y-coordinates

# Get coordinate vectors
x_vector = grid.x_vector  # 1D array of x-coordinates
y_vector = grid.y_vector  # 1D array of y-coordinates

# Get affine transform
affine = grid.affine
```

#### RasterGrid Operations

```python
# Subset to a region
from rasters import BBox
subset_bbox = BBox(-115, 32, -112, 38, crs="EPSG:4326")
subset_grid = grid.subset(subset_bbox)

# Slice using indices
subset_grid = grid[100:200, 150:250]

# Change resolution
rescaled_grid = grid.rescale(cell_size=0.002)

# Buffer the grid
buffered_grid = grid.buffer(pixels=10)

# Shift the grid
shifted_grid = grid.shift_xy(x_shift=100, y_shift=50)
```

### Working with RasterGeolocation

The `RasterGeolocation` class represents swath raster geometry using 2D geolocation arrays, commonly used for satellite swath data.

#### Creating RasterGeolocation Objects

```python
from rasters import RasterGeolocation
import numpy as np

# From x and y coordinate arrays
x_coords = np.random.uniform(-120, -110, (500, 500))
y_coords = np.random.uniform(30, 40, (500, 500))
geolocation = RasterGeolocation(x_coords, y_coords, crs="EPSG:4326")

# From coordinate vectors (creates meshgrid)
x_vector = np.linspace(-120, -110, 500)
y_vector = np.linspace(30, 40, 500)
geolocation = RasterGeolocation.from_vectors(x_vector, y_vector, crs="EPSG:4326")
```

#### RasterGeolocation Properties

```python
# Get dimensions
rows = geolocation.rows
cols = geolocation.cols

# Get coordinate arrays
x = geolocation.x  # 2D array of x-coordinates
y = geolocation.y  # 2D array of y-coordinates

# Get extent
xmin, ymin = geolocation.x_min, geolocation.y_min
xmax, ymax = geolocation.x_max, geolocation.y_max

# Get cell size (estimated from median distances)
cell_size = geolocation.cell_size

# Get boundary polygon
boundary = geolocation.boundary
```

#### RasterGeolocation Operations

```python
# Index with geometry
from rasters import Polygon
polygon = Polygon([(-115, 32), (-112, 32), (-112, 38), (-115, 38)])
mask = geolocation.index(polygon)

# Generate a regular grid from geolocation
grid = geolocation.grid

# Resize geolocation arrays
resized = geolocation.resize(dimensions=(250, 250))

# Subset to a region
subset = geolocation.subset(polygon)
```

### Working with Points and Vector Geometries

```python
from rasters import Point, Polygon, BBox

# Create a point
point = Point(-115.5, 35.2, crs="EPSG:4326")

# Transform point to different CRS
utm_point = point.to_crs("EPSG:32611")

# Create a polygon
polygon = Polygon([
    (-115, 32),
    (-112, 32),
    (-112, 38),
    (-115, 38)
], crs="EPSG:4326")

# Create a bounding box
bbox = BBox(xmin=-120, ymin=30, xmax=-110, ymax=40, crs="EPSG:4326")

# Sample raster at point
value = raster.to_point(point)

# Clip raster to polygon
clipped = raster.subset(polygon)
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Merging Multiple Rasters

```python
# Open multiple rasters
raster1 = Raster.open("tile1.tif")
raster2 = Raster.open("tile2.tif")
raster3 = Raster.open("tile3.tif")

# Merge into a single raster
merged = Raster.merge([raster1, raster2, raster3])
```

#### Resampling with KDTree

```python
from rasters import KDTree

# Create a KDTree for efficient resampling
kd_tree = KDTree(
    source_geometry=source_raster.geometry,
    target_geometry=target_grid,
    radius_of_influence=1000  # meters
)

# Resample using the KDTree
resampled = source_raster.resample(target_grid, kd_tree=kd_tree)

# Save KDTree for reuse
kd_tree.save("kdtree.pkl")

# Load KDTree
kd_tree = KDTree.load("kdtree.pkl")
```

#### Working with Masks

```python
# Create a mask
mask = raster > 0.5

# Apply mask to raster
masked_raster = raster.mask(mask)

# Fill masked values with another raster
filled = raster.fill(fill_raster)
```
    
## Changelog

### 1.1.0

The `KDTree` class can now save to file with the `.save` method and load from file with the `KDTree.load` class method.
